## Course Description

This course introduces students to the use of computational methods to
study humanistic disciplines (art, literature, history, politics,
religion, music, etc.), This method of inquiry is known as "digital
humanities." Students will learn the programming language Python in
order to apply methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), web
scraping, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), topic modeling,
Named Entity Recognition (NER), and mapping. Assignments analyze
primarily text-based sources in English, and the methods can be applied
to a wide range of languages, ancient and modern. No programming skills
are assumed.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

1.  Explain what the digital humanities are and how they relate to other
    forms of humanities research;
2.  Write and execute basic Python scripts;
3.  Pre-process a text/corpus in preparation for natural language
    processing;
4.  Parse complex data structures such as Python dictionaries and Pandas
    data frames;
5.  Apply digital methodologies of various kinds to humanities related
    data;
6.  Evaluate the methodologies and results of digital humanities
    projects.

## Assignments

- **Weekly coding assignments** - Students will complete weekly coding
assignments to practice the concepts learned in class.
- **Discussion Posts** - Students will spend time reading and reflecting
on course readings. These reflections will share those reflections in
online discussion posts
- **DH Project Evaluations** - Students will evaluate various DH projects
with the goal of thinking carefully about a broad range of DH research.
- **Programming Historian Lessons** - Students will complete mini-projects
from the Programming Historian as a means to broaden both their coding
skills and to find examples of different kinds of DH projects.
- **Final Project** - Students will complete a "Programming
Historian"-style project where they apply a programming methodology they
learned in the class to a dataset of their own choosing. Final projects
will contain a brief introduction, code, artifacts, and discussion.
- **Self-Reflection** - Students will complete a brief self-reflection at
the end of the term about their involvement in the course.

discretion.

## Classroom Policy Statements

**Academic integrity syllabus statement**: Tufts holds its students
strictly accountable for adherence to academic integrity. The
consequences for violations can be severe. It is critical that you
understand the requirements of ethical behavior and academic work as
described in [Tufts' Academic Integrity
handbook](https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/support-resources/academic-integrity-resources).

If you ever have a question about the expectations concerning a
particular assignment or project in this course, be sure to ask me for
clarification. The Faculty of the School of Arts and Sciences and the
School of Engineering are required to report suspected cases of academic
integrity violations to the Dean of Student Affairs Office. If I suspect
that you have cheated or plagiarized in this class, I must report the
situation to the dean.

**A Note on ChatGPT (and other similar tools**): I do not have a
categorical objection to ChatGPT or other similar tools. In fact, later
in the semester we will discuss large language models (LLMs). Here are
some guidelines:

-   You **may** copy code from ChatGPT (or StackOverflow for that
    matter), but *be sure you understand what the code is doing*.
-   You **may not use** ChatGPT (or other similar tools) to complete
    your written assignments for you. If you find yourself
    copying/pasting from a different source without attribution or if
    you find yourself editing a different source to make it sound like
    your writing, you are plagiarizing and will be reported.


## Student Resources

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**: Tufts University
values the diversity of our students, staff, and \*\*faculty and
recognizes the important contribution each student makes to our unique
community. Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to
all qualified students through the provision of reasonable
accommodations so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts
experience. If you have a disability that requires reasonable
accommodations, please contact the StAAR Center (formerly Student
Accessibility Services) at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or 617-627-4539 to make
an appointment with an accessibility representative to determine
appropriate accommodations. Please be aware that accommodations cannot
be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their
provision.

**Academic Support at the StAAR Center**: The StAAR Center (formerly the
Academic Resource Center and Student Accessibility Services) offers a
variety of resources to all students (both undergraduate and graduate)
in the Schools of Arts and Science, Engineering, the SMFA and Fletcher;
services are free to all enrolled students. Students may make an
appointment to work on any writing-related project or assignment, attend
subject tutoring in a variety of disciplines, or meet with an academic
coach to hone fundamental academic skills like time management or
overcoming procrastination. Students can make an appointment for any of
these services by visiting the [StAAR Center
website](https://go.tufts.edu/StAARCenter).

**Mental Health Support**: As a student, there may be times when
personal stressors or emotional difficulties interfere with your
academic performance or well-being. The Counseling and Mental Health
Service (CMHS) provides confidential consultation, brief counseling, and
urgent care at no cost for all Tufts undergraduates as well as for
graduate students who have paid the student health fee. To make an
appointment, call 617-627-3360. [Please visit the CMHS
website](https://go.tufts.edu/Counseling) to learn more about their
services and resources.
