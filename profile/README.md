## Course Description

This course introduces students to the use of computational methods to study humanistic disciplines (art, literature,
history, politics, religion, music, etc.), This method of inquiry is known as "digital humanities." Students will learn
the programming language Python in order to apply methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), web scraping,
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), topic modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and mapping. Assignments
analyze primarily text-based sources in English, and the methods can be applied to a wide range of languages, ancient
and modern. No programming skills are assumed.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to

1.	Explain what the digital humanities are and how they relate to other forms of humanities research;
2.	Write and execute basic Python scripts;
3.	Pre-process a text/corpus in preparation for natural language processing;
4.	Parse complex data structures such as Python dictionaries and Pandas data frames;
5.	Apply digital methodologies of various kinds to humanities related data;
6.	Evaluate the methodologies and results of digital humanities projects.

## Required Texts

Matthes, Eric. _Python Crash Course: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming_. 3rd Edition. No Starch Press, 2023.

O'Sullivan, James. _The Bloomsbury Handbook to Digital Humanities_. London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2022.

Rockwell, Geoffrey and Stefan Sinclair. _Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities_. MIT Press, 2016.

NB: Additional readings (listed below) will be made available on Canvas.


## Assignments

**Weekly coding assignments** - Students will complete weekly coding assignments to practice the concepts learned in
class.

**Discussion Posts** - Students will spend time reading and reflecting on course readings. These reflections will share
those reflections in online discussion posts

**DH Project Evaluations** - Students will evaluate various DH projects with the goal of thinking carefully about a
broad range of DH research.

**Programming Historian Lessons** - Students will complete mini-projects from the Programming Historian as a means to
broaden both their coding skills and to find examples of different kinds of DH projects.

**Final Project** - Students will complete a "Programming Historian"-style project where they apply a programming
methodology they learned in the class to a dataset of their own choosing. Final projects will contain a brief
introduction, code, artifacts, and discussion.

**Self-Reflection** - Students will complete a brief self-reflection at the end of the term about their involvement in
the course.


## Evaluation/Assessment

For a grade in the “A” range, students must complete the following:

-	All weekly coding assignments
-	10 discussion posts
-	2 DH project evaluations (written)
-	1 DH project evaluation (group presentation)
-	3 Programming Historian lessons
-	Self- reflection
-	Final project

For a grade in the “B” range, students must complete the following

-	All weekly coding assignments
-	7 discussion posts
-	1 DH project evaluations (written)
-	1 DH project evaluation (group presentation)
-	2 Programming Historian lessons
-	Self-reflection
-	Final project

For a grade in the “C” range, students must complete the following:

-	Half of the weekly coding assignments
-	5 discussion posts
-	1 DH project evaluations (written)
-	1 DH project evaluation (group presentation)
-	1 Programming Historian lessons
-	Self-reflection

Students who neglect to make the minimum requirements for a grade in the “C” range will be assigned a “D” or an “F” at
the instructor’s discretion.


## Classroom Policy Statements

**Academic integrity syllabus statement**: Tufts holds its students strictly accountable for adherence
to academic integrity. The consequences for violations can be severe. It is critical that you understand
the requirements of ethical behavior and academic work as described in [Tufts’ Academic Integrity
handbook](https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/support-resources/academic-integrity-resources). If you ever
have a question about the expectations concerning a particular assignment or project in this course, be sure to ask me
for clarification. The Faculty of the School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are required to report
suspected cases of academic integrity violations to the Dean of Student Affairs Office. If I suspect that you have
cheated or plagiarized in this class, I must report the situation to the dean.

**A Note on ChatGPT (and other similar tools**): I do not have a categorical objection to ChatGPT or other similar
tools. In fact, later in the semester we will discuss large language models (LLMs). Here are some guidelines:

-	You **may** copy code from ChatGPT (or StackOverflow for that matter), but _be sure you understand what the code is
doing_.
-	You **may not use** ChatGPT (or other similar tools) to complete your written assignments for you. If you find
yourself copying/pasting from a different source without attribution or if you find yourself editing a different source
to make it sound like your writing, you are plagiarizing and will be reported.

## Student Resources

**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**: Tufts University values the diversity of our students, staff, and
**faculty and recognizes the important contribution each student makes to our unique community. Tufts is committed
to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations
so that each student may fully participate in the Tufts experience. If you have a disability that requires reasonable
accommodations, please contact the StAAR Center (formerly Student Accessibility Services) at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or
617-627-4539 to make an appointment with an accessibility representative to determine appropriate accommodations. Please
be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.

**Academic Support at the StAAR Center**: The StAAR Center (formerly the Academic Resource Center and Student
Accessibility Services) offers a variety of resources to all students (both undergraduate and graduate) in the Schools
of Arts and Science, Engineering, the SMFA and Fletcher; services are free to all enrolled students. Students may
make an appointment to work on any writing-related project or assignment, attend subject tutoring in a variety of
disciplines, or meet with an academic coach to hone fundamental academic skills like time management or overcoming
procrastination. Students can make an appointment for any of these services by visiting the [StAAR Center website](https://go.tufts.edu/StAARCenter).

**Mental Health Support**: As a student, there may be times when personal stressors or emotional difficulties interfere
with your academic performance or well-being. The Counseling and Mental Health Service (CMHS) provides confidential
consultation, brief counseling, and urgent care at no cost for all Tufts undergraduates as well as for graduate
students who have paid the student health fee. To make an appointment, call 617-627-3360. [Please visit the CMHS
website](https://go.tufts.edu/Counseling) to learn more about their services and resources.
